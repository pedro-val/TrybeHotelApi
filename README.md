### TrybeHotel API
This is the repository for the TrybeHotel API, an API developed in several stages for managing cities, hotels, rooms, bookings, and integration with geographical information based on addresses. The API was developed in C# with ASP.NET and uses a database to store information about hotels, cities, rooms, users, and bookings.

### Project Stages
The TrybeHotel project was developed in four distinct stages, each with its own requirements and functionalities. Below, you will find a description of each project stage and the technologies used:

### Phase A: Starting the Development
In this phase, the goal was to start developing the API and create routes for the entities of cities, hotels, and rooms. Endpoints were developed to list, create, and update information about these entities.

### Technologies Used:

ASP.NET
C#
Database

### Phase B: Adding Authentication and Security
In this phase, the API was expanded to include user authentication and authorization policies. Routes for user registration and login were added, as well as authorization policies for secure operations.

### Technologies Used:

ASP.NET
C#
JWT Tokens
Authorization Policies

### Phase C: Integration with Geographical Information
In this phase, the API was enhanced to search for hotels based on geographical address information. Attributes and functionalities were added to improve hotel searches near an address.

### Technologies Used:

ASP.NET
C#
Integration with External Geographical Information API

### Phase D: Preparing for Deployment
In the final phase, the API was prepared for deployment. A standard route to check the applicationâ€™s status was added, and a Dockerfile was created to facilitate the deployment of the API in a production environment.

### Technologies Used:

ASP.NET
C#
Docker

### API Endpoints
